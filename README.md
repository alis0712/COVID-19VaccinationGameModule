# COVID-19 Vaccination Game Module

This is my first minigame built in Unity 3D engine where the goal of the player is to get vaccinated once he starts driving. A small gif is shown below:

1) A custom terrain with rigged 3d models, some of these models were animated and rigged using Adobe Mixamo. The custom terrain included things like clouds, water, palm trees, and so forth. 
2) Added a Player Controller to the Scene. The player was given a gun and had the ability to shoot and cycle through the weapons.
3) Added custom audio components to the Scene.
4) Created obstacles with health counter (behavior). When the player enters the fire it loses its health, or when the player enters fire.
5) Created an evacuation drill, where certain NPCs are running away and other NPCs are going towards the hospital.
